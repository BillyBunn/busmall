## Market researcher
	1. As a market researcher, I want a professional-looking website for focus group participants to use, so that they take our research and compensation offer seriously.
	2. As a market researcher, I want to display three products at a time (side-by-side) to the focus group participant and display three new images after one is clicked 25 times, so that participants can see all proposed BusMall products and convey their interests. 
	3. As a market researcher, I want to track the number of times focus group participants click on each product image so that I can rank all 25 products by consumer interest. 
	4. As a market researcher, I want to know the total number of times each product was clicked and the percentage of times an item was clicked when it was shown, so that I have more relative data for my client.
	5. As a market researcher, I want to visually display the resulting data to my client so that they can easily understand which potential products are more likely to sell, so that our client pays us, and so that we have a good reputation for future business.
